# ETL Classes and Functions #
## Introduction ##
In this session, you will find the classes that were created to perform the **extraction** and the **transformation** stages of the ETL process. The former is a `WebScraper` class that handles all the steps taken to extract the data from the website. The later, `Transformer`, takes care of all processes used to get the data in shape and make it ready for analysis.
